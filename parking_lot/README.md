The parking lot problem solution is coded in python language.
The main program is under /parking_lot/src/main.py file.We have 2 more python class modules 
1. parking_lot_slots under parking_lot/src folder
2. parking_car_details under parking_lot/src/parking_car_details folder 

The parking_lot_slots stores the dict(dictionary object)  of parking_slots requested.The other module parking_car_details stores the parking_car_details like parking_slot_id,parking_car_number,parking_car_color.

The main program contains options to take command line inputs and option to accept input values which can execute the commands one by one maintained in the file. The file name is file_inputs.txt which is available under parking_lot/bin folder

The main.py file can be executed directly from parking_lot/bin/parking_lot file. The file is a shell script which call the python main.py file
